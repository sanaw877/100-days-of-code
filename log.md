# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 15, 2020 
#### Coronavirus and VPN issues gave me a lot of free time to focus on learning today. While this challenge technically states that courses don't count, I'm going to change that since I believe that the courses I'm taking will help in achieving my goals.
**Today's Progress**: Completed the Numpy/Pandas sections of the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course by Jose Portilla on Udemy. 

**Thoughts:** The exercises weren't too difficult for me, though a good way to practice different ways of doing things. Also learned about the nlargest and nsmallest functions, which is much more efficient that sort_values() so that was nice.

**Link to work:** I shall link the notebook when I figure that out.

### Day 1: March 16, 2020 
##### More VPN issues, so I had a good chunk of time for learning. Went through most of the data visualization portions of the Udemy DS and ML course.
**Today's Progress**: Completed sections on matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas plotting

**Thoughts**: I knew some of this stuff already but it was a good refresher. One of my goals is to get really good with matplotlib so this is a nice starting point.

### Days 2-6: March 17-21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up lessons on data visualization and worked on Flask app for work. 
**Thoughts** Plotly is really cool but also kind of confusing. Will need to look into it more, since it took me forever to make that map. I've been doing at least an hour of coding a day but keep forgetting to track it! Really need to get better at that.

### Day 7: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wrote small script to keep track of my siblings credit card usage. 
**Thoughts** This was a fun little project. I'd like to add the ability to summarize the info and modify it to run regularly and extract the last X amount of days or something similar.

### Day 8: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on new project to analyze NYT obituaries. Wrote small script to find bakeries in NY for volunteer work.
**Thoughts** I wish API's didn't have limits :(

### Day 9: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More data visualization practice with matplotlib. Worked on blackjack game for other Udemy class.
**Thoughts** I am beginning to like matplotlob. Also, why do all classes assume that everyone knows cards. I know noting about cards! Flashbacks to math class.
