# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 15, 2020 
#### Coronavirus and VPN issues gave me a lot of free time to focus on learning today. While this challenge technically states that courses don't count, I'm going to change that since I believe that the courses I'm taking will help in achieving my goals.
**Today's Progress**: Completed the Numpy/Pandas sections of the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course by Jose Portilla on Udemy. 

**Thoughts:** The exercises weren't too difficult for me, though a good way to practice different ways of doing things. Also learned about the nlargest and nsmallest functions, which is much more efficient that sort_values() so that was nice.

**Link to work:** I shall link the notebook when I figure that out.

### Day 1: March 16, 2020 
##### More VPN issues, so I. had a good chunk of time for learning. Went through most of the data visualization portions of the Udemy DS and ML course.
**Today's Progress**: Completed sections on matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas plotting

**Thoughts**: I knew some of this stuff already but it was a good refresher. One of my goals is to get really good with matplotlib so this is a nice starting point.
